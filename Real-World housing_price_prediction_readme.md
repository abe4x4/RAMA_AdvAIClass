# Real-World Linear Regression: House Price Prediction


##  **Project Overview**

This comprehensive tutorial demonstrates **linear regression in a real business context** using house price prediction for a fictional real estate company called **"PropertyPro Analytics"**. Unlike academic examples, this project shows how to apply machine learning to solve actual business problems with realistic data, stakeholder communication, and production deployment considerations.

###  **Business Problem**
PropertyPro Analytics needs to:
- **Predict house prices accurately** to stay competitive in the market
- **Understand key factors** that drive house prices in their metropolitan area
- **Provide data-driven insights** to real estate agents and clients
- **Reduce pricing errors** that cost the company significant revenue

##  **Business Context**

### **Company**: PropertyPro Analytics (Real Estate Company)
### **Role**: You are a Data Scientist
### **Stakeholders**: 
- Real estate agents
- Property buyers and sellers
- Company executives
- Revenue management team

### **Business Impact**:
- Help agents price properties accurately
- Enable buyers to make informed decisions  
- Optimize company pricing strategies
- Reduce revenue loss from pricing errors

##  **What the Model Predicts**

### **Primary Goal:**
**Predicts the sale price of residential properties** based on various house and neighborhood characteristics.

### **Model Type:** 
**Linear Regression** - chosen for:
-  **Interpretability**: Easy to explain to business stakeholders
-  **Linear relationships**: Clear connections between features and prices
-  **Regulatory compliance**: Explainable AI for real estate decisions
