#  Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction Project



##  **Project Overview**

This project analyzes hotel booking data to **predict whether a customer will cancel their hotel reservation**. Using machine learning classification algorithms, we help hotels better understand booking patterns and reduce revenue loss from cancellations.

###  **Business Problem**
Hotel cancellations significantly impact revenue and resource planning. By predicting which bookings are likely to be canceled, hotels can:
- **Optimize overbooking strategies**
- **Improve revenue management**
- **Better allocate resources and staff**
- **Enhance customer service strategies**

##  **Dataset Information**

### **Source Data**
- **Dataset**: `hotel_bookings.csv`
- **Records**: 119,390 hotel bookings
- **Features**: 32 variables
- **Hotels**: Two types (Resort Hotel and City Hotel)
- **Time Period**: Multi-year booking data

### **Key Features**
| Feature Category | Examples | Description |
|------------------|----------|-------------|
| **Booking Details** | lead_time, booking_changes | When and how booking was made |
| **Stay Information** | arrival_date, stays_in_weekend_nights | When and how long |
| **Guest Details** | adults, children, babies, country | Who is staying |
| **Hotel Features** | hotel, room_type, meal | What type of accommodation |
| **Business Metrics** | adr (average daily rate), market_segment | Pricing and business context |
| **Target Variable** | **is_canceled** | **0 = Not Canceled, 1 = Canceled** |

##  **What the Model Predicts**

### **Primary Prediction**
```
BINARY CLASSIFICATION PROBLEM
Input: Hotel booking features (lead time, guest count, room type, etc.)
Output: Will this booking be canceled? (Yes/No)
```

### **Prediction Categories**
- **0 (Not Canceled)**: Guest will arrive and complete their stay
- **1 (Canceled)**: Guest will cancel their reservation

##  **Project Analysis Sections**

### **1. Data Exploration & Insights**
- **Geographic Analysis**: Where do guests come from?
- **Pricing Analysis**: How much do guests pay per night?
- **Seasonal Patterns**: Which months are busiest?
- **Guest Behavior**: Weekend vs weekday preferences

### **2. Feature Engineering**
```python
# Created meaningful features
data['is_family'] = (adults > 0) & (children > 0 or babies > 0)
data['total_customer'] = adults + babies + children
data['total_nights'] = stays_in_week_nights + stays_in_weekend_nights
```

### **3. Data Preprocessing**
- **Missing Value Treatment**: Handled missing countries, agent info
- **Outlier Management**: Log transformation for skewed features
- **Feature Encoding**: Mean encoding for categorical variables
- **Feature Selection**: Lasso regression for important features

### **4. Machine Learning Models**
The project tests multiple algorithms:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Naive Bayes**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

##  **Key Business Insights**

### ** Geographic Patterns**
- **Primary Markets**: Portugal and European countries dominate bookings
- **Global Reach**: Guests from worldwide locations
- **Market Focus**: European leisure and business travelers

### ** Pricing Analysis**
- **Room Type Impact**: Different room types show significant price variations
- **Hotel Differences**: Resort vs City hotel pricing strategies differ
- **Seasonal Pricing**: Summer premiums for resort properties

### ** Seasonal Trends**
- **Peak Seasons**: Summer months show highest occupancy
- **City vs Resort**: Different seasonal patterns
- **Business Planning**: Clear monthly demand patterns

### ** Guest Behavior**
- **Family vs Individual**: Different cancellation patterns
- **Stay Duration**: Weekend vs weekday preferences
- **Booking Patterns**: Lead time influences cancellation rates

##  **Model Performance & Interpretation**

### **Model Evaluation Metrics**
```python
# Example Results (varies by model)
Accuracy Score: ~80-85%
Cross-Validation Score: ~80-82%
Confusion Matrix: Shows True/False Positives and Negatives
```

### **Feature Importance**
Based on Lasso feature selection, key predictors include:
1. **Lead Time**: How far in advance booking was made
2. **Hotel Type**: Resort vs City hotel
3. **Market Segment**: Business, leisure, group bookings
4. **Average Daily Rate (ADR)**: Price sensitivity
5. **Previous Cancellations**: Historical behavior
6. **Deposit Type**: Payment commitment level

##  **Business Applications**

### **Revenue Management**
```
Use Case: Dynamic Pricing
- High cancellation probability → Lower prices to attract committed guests
- Low cancellation probability → Premium pricing for reliable bookings
```

### **Overbooking Strategy**
```
 Use Case: Inventory Management
- Predict cancellations to optimize room availability
- Reduce revenue loss from empty rooms
- Minimize overbooking compensation costs
```

### **Customer Service**
```
 Use Case: Proactive Engagement
- Target high-risk bookings with retention campaigns
- Offer flexible terms to reduce cancellation likelihood
- Personalize communication based on cancellation risk
```

##  **How to Interpret Results**

### **For Hotel Managers**
```
 Low Cancellation Risk (0.0-0.3):
- Reliable bookings, standard operations
- Focus on service excellence
- Minimal overbooking needed

 Medium Risk (0.3-0.7):
- Monitor closely, consider retention offers
- Moderate overbooking strategy
- Proactive customer communication

 High Risk (0.7-1.0):
- Implement retention strategies immediately
- Higher overbooking to compensate
- Offer flexible cancellation terms
```

### **For Revenue Teams**
```
 Actionable Insights:
- Adjust pricing based on cancellation probability
- Optimize marketing spend on reliable segments
- Plan capacity based on predicted show rates
- Develop targeted retention campaigns
```

##  **Technical Implementation**

### **Data Pipeline**
```
Raw Data → Cleaning → Feature Engineering → Encoding → 
Model Training → Validation → Prediction → Business Action
```

### **Model Deployment Considerations**
1. **Real-time Predictions**: Score new bookings as they arrive
2. **Batch Processing**: Daily updates for existing reservations
3. **A/B Testing**: Compare model performance against current strategies
4. **Monitoring**: Track prediction accuracy vs actual cancellations
